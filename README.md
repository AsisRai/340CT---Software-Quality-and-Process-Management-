Case Study – Smart-Mart Stock Monitoring System

A local mini mart is planning to have an electronic Stock Control and Monitoring (SCM) system to automate its stock handling process. You are assigned to develop an event-driven system and manage this project for the company. The mini mart has provided the following requirements for the SCM system. The stock control assistants should be able to enter the details for stock items into the system as below:

• item code • item name • item price • item quantity • stock arrival date • minimum required for an item (i.e. the minimum of an item required before placing an order) • maximum required for an item • staff check (i.e. stock control assistants)

The stock items that are arrived from the suppliers will be checked against the orders placed by the stock control assistants, who will then sign off the order. The stock will also be constantly checked against the sales on the system to determine whether an item is required to be ordered. The store manager will view a stock report at the end of each day to see the sales trend, which will help set the level of stock required in response to the market demands. The manager will also enter any new items to be ordered or delete any items that are no longer in demand.

All store staff should be able to log onto the SCM system to view the stock status for items, which may include: ‘awaiting a re-order’, ‘order placed, ‘low in stock’.

The store would also welcome any additional features recommended by the developer. Please note: • You may make necessary assumptions for the above case study.
